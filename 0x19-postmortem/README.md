### Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:**  
Start: August 20, 2024, 08:30 AM (UTC)  
End: August 20, 2024, 11:00 AM (UTC)  
**Impact:**  
During the outage, the company’s primary web application experienced a significant slowdown, resulting in page load times exceeding 30 seconds. Approximately 60% of users were affected, primarily those attempting to access the service from North America and Europe. Customers reported issues with logging in, and some were unable to complete transactions.  
**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was identified as a memory leak in the server-side application caused by a recent update to a third-party library. The leak led to a rapid consumption of memory resources, which caused the application to slow down and eventually become unresponsive for a large portion of users.

### Timeline

- **08:30 AM** - The issue was detected via an automated monitoring alert that flagged a spike in response times.
- **08:35 AM** - Engineers began investigating the web application server and noticed high memory usage.
- **08:45 AM** - Initial assumption: database performance issue. Database queries were analyzed, but nothing abnormal was found.
- **09:00 AM** - The issue was escalated to the backend team as the investigation focused on the server-side application.
- **09:30 AM** - Engineers discovered a memory leak in the server caused by a recent update to a third-party library used for data processing.
- **10:00 AM** - A rollback to the previous version of the library was initiated.
- **10:45 AM** - The rollback was completed, and the memory usage returned to normal.
- **11:00 AM** - The service was fully restored, and the web application returned to normal performance.

### Root Cause and Resolution

The issue was traced back to a recent update of a third-party data processing library that introduced a memory leak. This memory leak caused the server to allocate memory without properly releasing it, leading to rapid memory consumption. As the memory usage increased, the server's performance degraded, causing slow response times and unresponsiveness for a significant portion of users.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team identified the problematic update and rolled back to the previous stable version of the library. Once the rollback was completed, memory usage normalized, and the application performance returned to expected levels. No data loss or corruption was reported.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. **Improve Testing:** Implement more rigorous testing for third-party library updates, including stress tests to identify potential memory leaks before deployment.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up more granular monitoring for server memory usage, specifically tracking spikes that could indicate leaks.
3. **Automated Rollback:** Develop automated rollback procedures to quickly revert to previous stable versions in case of future issues.

**Tasks:**

- Conduct a full code review to ensure no other parts of the application are affected by similar issues.
- Add unit tests and integration tests for any future updates to third-party libraries.
- Patch the server’s monitoring system to include alerts for rapid memory consumption increases.
- Create a runbook for handling memory leak incidents, detailing the steps for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving such issues.
- Schedule a training session for engineers to better understand the impact of third-party libraries and how to manage them effectively.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future and improve our response time if they do.
